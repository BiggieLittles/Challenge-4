This is my verison of a simple quiz that has a 90 sec timer each question 
It gives the user a simple interface with 4 questions that they can choose from
When the users mouse hovers over the different selections the answers highlight and when it is selected it stays highlighted
At the end there is a sumbission button for a person to enter their name to represent the results they have !

after a few revisions i made the site look a little more accessible with adding the border radius feature and aligning all the text in the document and also adding a background image ðŸ˜Œ
